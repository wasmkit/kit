## TODO

- Better logging and warning
  - notes:
  - nothing too complex, just a little neater and defined (errors too)
  - maybe pre-defined errors and then ERRORS.md describing them
- wasm: Add wasm section parsers
- wasm: Add APIs to fetch intersection data
- TESTS
  - notes
  - Maybe wasm-tools smithy for fuzzing
- Think about where to stuff AST stuff
